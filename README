FreeDV for Android
==================

December 2012 Joel Stanley <joel@jms.id.au>

This application is for using FreeDV on Android.

From FreeDV.org:

 > FreeDV is a GUI application for Windows and Linux (MacOS and BSD are in
 > testing) that allows any SSB radio to be used for low bit rate digital voice.
 >
 > Speech is compressed down to 1400 bit/s then modulated onto a 1100 Hz wide QPSK
 > signal which is sent to the Mic input of a SSB radio. On receive, the signal is
 > received by the SSB radio, then demodulated and decoded by FreeDV.
 >
 > FreeDV was built by an international team of Radio Amateurs working together on
 > coding, design, user interface and testing. FreeDV is open source software,
 > released under the GNU Public License version 2.1. The FDMDV modem and Codec 2
 > Speech codec used in FreeDV are also open source.
